1. Why have you decided to learn Git and GitHub?
	One of the key skills in computer science is pair programming. However, distributed workflow in coding teams is the more robust and real world version of pair programming. 
	GitHub is the main way that this is accomplished in the real world, and yet many of the current coding programs for high school students does not truly teach this methodology and process. 
	It is my belief that learning GitHub will position my students so that they are ready and able to utilize GitHub effectively in the future among peers and in the workplace. 
	However, based on the where I am teaching at (small rural school in the middle of nowhere) it is necessary that I also become skilled at this software interface for their benefit
	(If not me, then who will teach this to the students? Will they learn it on their own? Some will, many won't, and those are who we stand to lose). 

2. How do you plan to use GitHub in your classroom?
	GitHub will be rolled out tentatively with my students in AP CS A this year, with a continual roll out to AP CS Principles, and then my intro course that is focused on Python Data Science. 
	In this process, I'll be able to have the most experienced students trouble shoot the process first this year, then next year have a few select that are skilled at it as we roll it out to a larger audience, and so on. 
	Overtime, this will also be rolled out to another teacher at our school, the First Robotics Teacher, so that the skill and process becomes an eventual way of doing business in our school. 
	
3. What are ways that GitHub might help you/students manage code? 
	This will help immensely on projects that are multi-part and multi-step. This is a key part of AP CS A and AP CS P.
